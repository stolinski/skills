# Output Contract

Version: 1.6

This contract defines the mandatory output structure and quality gates for Graffiti best-practices generation.

## 1) Mandatory Response Sections (In Order)

Every response must include these sections in this order:

1. **Intent and Constraints**
   - One sentence summarizing user goal.
   - List explicit constraints (framework, scope, interaction requirements, accessibility, style limits).

2. **System-First Preflight**
   - Report coverage for variables, theme, layout primitives, utilities, and components.
   - Mark each as PASS/FAIL with one short evidence note.

3. **Source Grounding**
   - List the exact sources used to validate classes and variable contracts.
   - Must include at least one hosted docs markdown URL from `https://graffiti-ui.com/{base|utilities|elements|ui-blocks}` and one stylesheet/package-contract source.

4. **Primitive Mapping**
   - Map each requested component/interaction to a Graffiti primitive.
   - Format: `<requested piece> -> <primitive> -> <source path>`.
   - If no direct primitive exists, include fallback mapping and limitation note.

5. **Component Intent Fit**
   - Validate each role-specific component choice against `references/COMPONENT_INTENT_MATRIX.md`.
   - Format: `<component class> -> <intended role> -> <fit result>`.
   - If any component fails intent fit, show remap to neutral/correct primitive before final markup.
   - Must explicitly confirm `.card*` classes are not being used as generic wrappers.

6. **Recipe Selection**
   - State which canonical pattern(s) are being used.
   - State baseline template URL used from `https://graffiti-ui.com/templates/*`.
   - If no baseline template match exists, explicitly state "No baseline template match found".
   - If no exact recipe exists, state closest fallback and why.

7. **Markup Output**
   - Provide one final code block (`html` or `svelte`) that is ready to use.
   - No pseudo-code.

8. **Verification Checklist**
   - Report pass/fail for each quality gate in section 6.
   - Include inline style declaration count and budget result.
   - Include unknown class count and unknown variable count.

9. **Post-Edit Compliance Report**
   - Explicitly prove no duplicate styling system was introduced.
   - Must include token, utility, and component duplication checks.

10. **Known Limitations and Adaptation Path**

- If any requirement could not be met with current classes, list limitation + fallback used.

## 2) Markup Rules

- Use only classes that exist in current Graffiti CSS.
- Use only CSS custom properties that exist in Graffiti token/component contracts.
- Reuse built-in Graffiti primitives instead of recreating them with bespoke wrappers/CSS/JS.
- Use role-specific components only when their intent fits; never pick components for visual chrome alone.
- Validate role fit using `references/COMPONENT_INTENT_MATRIX.md`.
- For critical patterns (dialog/modal, card/link, bubble/chat, form actions/options, input-group, callout), start from `references/CANONICAL_SNIPPETS.md` baselines.
- Use semantic HTML structure appropriate to the requested intent.
- Keep class usage compositional and readable (avoid unnecessary wrappers).
- Prefer existing utility/component classes over inline declarations.
- Use a Graffiti-first approach before adding custom CSS.
- When a matching hosted template exists, start from that template's structure and customize from it rather than generating a new unrelated structure.
- Custom CSS is allowed when needed, but it must be implemented as reusable project-level classes/utilities (not ad-hoc local overrides).

## 3) Inline Style Policy

### 3.1 Allowed Inline Styles

Allowed only when using custom property overrides or bounded layout exceptions.

Approved custom property examples:

- Spacing/layout: `--gap`, `--layout-gap`, `--min-card-width`, `--max-width`, `--padding`
- Component tokens: `--bubble-*`, `--toggle-color`, `--callout-*`, and `--tag-color` only for non-status category colors

Bounded layout exceptions:

- One-off `max-width` or width constraints where no utility exists

### 3.2 Disallowed Inline Styles

- Hardcoded color declarations (`color: #...`, `background: #...`) unless explicitly requested
- Unknown/unverified custom property names (for example undeclared `--card-accent`)
- Repeated margin reset patterns (`margin: 0`) where utility/class pattern can be used
- Ad-hoc typography styling that duplicates existing text classes
- Layout declarations (`display`, `grid-template-*`, etc.) where existing layout classes apply

### 3.3 Inline Style Budget

- Section-level budget: maximum 3 declarations per section
- Page-level budget: maximum 12 declarations total
- Any budget overrun requires explicit justification in Verification Checklist

## 4) Accessibility and Semantics Minimums

Must satisfy all of the following:

1. Landmark tags for page-level output (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `footer` as appropriate)
2. Logical heading hierarchy
3. Labels for all form controls
4. Correct table semantics for data tables
5. State attributes where applicable (`aria-current`, `open`, checked state)
6. Meaningful link/button semantics (navigation uses links, actions use buttons)

## 5) Framework Compatibility Rules

- Default output: framework-agnostic HTML.
- Svelte output is allowed when requested.
- In Svelte mode:
  - Prefer markup-first output for static sections.
  - Add script/state only when user explicitly requires interaction or dynamic behavior.
  - Do not introduce unnecessary runes/state for static sections.

## 6) Quality Gates (Scored + Hard Fails)

### 6.1 Weighted Score

Total score: 100

- Valid class usage (all classes exist): 30
- Component intent fit (role usage correctness): 10
- Inline style policy and budget compliance: 20
- Accessibility and semantics: 20
- Responsive composition quality: 15
- Fidelity to canonical Graffiti patterns: 5

Minimum pass score: 85

### 6.2 Hard Fail Conditions

Any hard fail means overall fail regardless of score:

1. Uses unknown class names
2. Uses unknown custom property names in markup
3. Re-implements built-in Graffiti primitives instead of using canonical patterns
4. Introduces a duplicate styling system (ad-hoc utility/component/token framework)
5. Violates disallowed inline style rules
6. Missing required accessibility baseline (labels/landmarks/table semantics)
7. Missing one or more mandatory response sections from section 1
8. Fails to use a matching hosted template baseline when one exists (unless user explicitly requested a fresh build)
9. Uses role-specific component classes outside intent boundaries from `COMPONENT_INTENT_MATRIX.md`

## 7) Verification Checklist Template

Use this exact checklist format in responses:

- Class validity: PASS/FAIL (unknown classes: N)
- Variable contract validity: PASS/FAIL (unknown custom properties: N)
- Built-in primitive reuse: PASS/FAIL (re-implemented primitives: N)
- Duplicate-system check: PASS/FAIL (new utility/component/token systems: YES/NO)
- Template baseline usage: PASS/FAIL (template path: <path or none>, preserved structure: YES/NO)
- Inline styles: PASS/FAIL (declarations: N, section max: N, page max: N)
- Accessibility semantics: PASS/FAIL (landmarks, headings, labels, states, table semantics)
- Responsive composition: PASS/FAIL (mobile + desktop layout behavior)
- Graffiti fidelity: PASS/FAIL (matches canonical composition patterns)
- Component intent fit: PASS/FAIL (role mismatches: N)
- Overall score: N/100 (PASS >= 85)

## 8) Post-Edit Compliance Report Template

Use this format:

- Token system reuse: PASS/FAIL (new token families introduced: YES/NO)
- Utility system reuse: PASS/FAIL (new ad-hoc utility framework introduced: YES/NO)
- Component system reuse: PASS/FAIL (custom reimplementation of built-ins: YES/NO)
- Canonical snippet adherence: PASS/FAIL (critical patterns matched: <list>)

## 9) Recovery Rules

If output fails any gate:

1. Remove or replace non-canonical classes.
2. Remap role-mismatched components using `COMPONENT_INTENT_MATRIX.md`.
3. Replace disallowed inline styles with class-based alternatives.
4. Add missing semantic/accessibility structure.
5. Recalculate score and re-run checklist.

If failure is due to an unsupported pattern, keep class-first fallback and document the limitation plus an optional adaptation path (for example a reusable custom class in project styles).
